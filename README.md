<h1>Interactive Mechanics Development </h1>

This repository showcases the technical development of interactions and gameplay mechanics for spatial immersive cubic space. Set of games developed with Unreal Engine and Touch Designer.   

> This repository documents the interactive mechanics and technical design.  
> The **primary goal** of this repository is to showcase the technical and interactive mechanics, featuring the role of developer.

• Developed and implemented real-time interactive pipelines in Unreal Engine and TouchDesigner, integrating tracking systems and sensor data to achieve stable, low-latency interaction behavior.

• Optimize rendering workflows for real-time output, including material logic, shader behavior, lighting systems, and performance budget.

• In collaboration with creative and technical directors, we created a multiplayer immersive gaming experience. I helped to develop the core gameplay system, and design interactive behaviour.


### Development of Core System 
1. Players Tracking & Data Mapping
 
Real-time position and orientation data is captured for each player. Then processed and normalized inside selected game engine.
Each player is assigned a persistent ID that remains stable throughout the entire experience (no ID switching or resets), ensuring consistent interaction logic.

2. Tracking data proceeds in Gthe ame engine and is developed into two primary Interaction layers:
     - Individual player tracking data (position, orientation, movement states)
   - Proccesed Average position data of all players - developed into main navigation principles that enable different gameplay modes.

This framework allows:
    - One-player mechanics
    - Multi-player cooperative behaviors
    - Global environment state changes
    - Adaptive difficulty based on group dynamics
**Developed Framework functions as a core for building diverse interactive mechanics.**

3. In Unreal Engine Technical architecture is built to keep core development structure modular and shared across all game variations. Any updates made in the master project propagate automatically to all derived game projects. 
    - Master components / Controls
    - Game Mechanic Components
      This ensures consistency and reduces duplication.


4. SHOW RUNN
   -The system was deployed using nDisplay, outputting content in 4K resolution in the immersive test environment

  ## Technical Art for spatial gaming and previsualizations
Development of spatial games in Unreal Engine requries RnD of the technical art, working with the shaders, finding solutions that will work for the spatial immersive environment.
- Shaders that work with the interaction logic
- Materials, VFX that works and looks cool with nDisplay rendering
- Combining with position data and blueprint coding
 
### Developed toolset in Unreal Engine for immersive scene previsualization

  For previsualizations, I  worked with the various CG pipelines, including animation, shaders in UE, and rendering.
   
## Highlighted dev mechanics

    -RnD of the core game mechanics 
    -RnD of the navigation principles
    -Real-time vertex paint and shader dev

## Touch Designer
One of the important task in the development was to define which gaming experience should be built in which real-time engine from the optimization and performance perspective,
A few interactive experiences are built in Touch Designer using Python to write logic.
