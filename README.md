<h1>Interactive Mechanics Development </h1>

This repository features technical dev showcase of interactions and gameplay mechanics for spatial immersive cubic space. Set of games developed with Unreal Engine and Touch Designer.   

> This repository documents the interactive mechanics and technical design.  
> The **primary goal** of this repo is to showcase the technical and interactive mechanics, featurimg the role of developer.

### Development of Core System 
1. Players Tracking & Data Mapping
 
Real-time position and orientation data is captured for each player. Then processed and normalized in selected game engine.
Developed in a a way that each player receives a persistent ID that remains consistent across the entire show.

2. Interaction Logic Framework inside Game Engine 
     - Individual player tracking data
   - Proccesed Average position of all players - developed into 3 main navigation principles, that applies to different gameplays

This framework allows:
    - One-player mechanics
    - Multi-player cooperative behaviors
    - Global environment state changes
    - Adaptive difficulty based on group dynamic
**Developed Framework is a core to create various interactive mechanics.**

3. In Unreal Engine Tecnical architecture builded to keep core development structure modular or same across games.If there is a change in master project it waill aplly to any other developed game gameproject. 
    - Master components / Controls
    - Game Mechanic Components


4. SHOW RUNN
   -With nDisplay outputing content in 4K resolution to test space. Reached FPS 50-60 on one RTX 4090.

  ## Technical Art for spatial gaming and previsualizations
Development of spatial games in Unreal Engine requries RnD of the technical art as well, working with the shader, finding out a solutions that will work for Spatial immersive enviropment.
- Shader that work with the interaction logic
- Materials, VFX that works and looks cool with nDisaplay rendering
- Combinig with position ddata and blueprit coding

    -Metasound and chain reaction between players
    -Real time vertex paint and shader dev


## Touch Designer
I defined which gaming experience should be build in which engine from the optimization and performance perspective,
A few interactive experiences build in the Touch Designer using Python to write a gaming logic. (appears it is the best approach)
