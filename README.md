<h1>Interactive Mechanics Development </h1>

This repository showcases the technical development of interactions and gameplay mechanics for spatial immersive cubic space. Set of games developed with Unreal Engine and Touch Designer.   

> This repository documents the interactive mechanics and technical design.  
> The **primary goal** of this repository is to showcase the technical and interactive mechanics, highlighting the role of a developer.

My role was:

• to design and develop the core gameplay system, game mechanics, and interactive behaviours. All within a strong focus on real-time interaction, player systems, and multiplayer logic. 

• Developed and implemented real-time interactive pipelines in Unreal Engine and TouchDesigner, integrating tracking systems and sensor data to achieve stable, low-latency interaction behavior.

• Optimize rendering workflows for real-time output, including material logic, shader behavior, lighting systems, and performance budget.




### Development of Core System 
1. Players Tracking & Data Mapping
 
Real-time position and orientation data are captured for each player. Then processed and normalized inside the selected game engine.
Each player is assigned a persistent ID that remains stable throughout the entire experience, ensuring consistent interaction logic.

2. Developed into two interactive layers:
     - Individual player tracking data (position, orientation, movement states)
   - Averaged position data of all players - developed into main navigation principles that enable different gameplay modes.

This framework allows:
    - Individual player game mechanics
    - Multiplayer cooperative gameplay behaviors
    - Global environment state changes
    - Adaptive difficulty based on group dynamics
**Developed Framework functions as a core for building diverse interactive mechanics.**

3. With the version control, the technical architecture of the full project is built to keep the core development structure modular and shared across all game variations. Any updates made in the master Unreal Engine project propagate automatically to all derived game projects. 
    - Master components / Controls
    - Game Mechanic Components
      This ensures consistency and reduces duplication. Allowing the team to collaborate seamlessly. 

4. Tools and pipelines:
    - Built internal tools and workflows to support level designers and content creators.

6. SHOW RUN
   -The system was deployed using nDisplay, outputting content in 4K resolution in the immersive test environment

  ## Technical Art for spatial gaming and previsualizations
Development of spatial games in Unreal Engine requries RnD of the technical art, working with shaders, VFX, and finding solutions that will work for the spatial immersive environment.
- Shader development
- Materials, VFX that works and looks cool with nDisplay rendering
- Combining with position data and blueprint coding
 
### Developed toolset in Unreal Engine for immersive scene previsualization

  For previsualizations, I  worked with the various CG pipelines, including animation, mockups, shaders in UE, and rendering.
   

## Touch Designer
One of the important tasks in the development was to define which gaming experience should be built in which real-time engine from the optimization and performance perspective.
A few interactive experiences are built in Touch Designer using Python for logic and data handling.
