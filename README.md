# Interactive-mechanics-Development-
This repository features technical documentation and showcase of development of interactions and gameplay mechanics for spatial immersive cubic space. Set of games developed with Unreal Engine and Touch Designer.   

> This repository documents the interactive mechanics and technical design behind the project.  
> The **primary goal** of this repo is to showcase the technical and interactive mechanics, not to publish full source code.


## Demo (Short)
*(You'll add GIFs here later)*

## Core System 
1. Players Tracking & Data Mapping
Real-time position and orientation data is captured for each player. Then processed and normalized in selected game engine. 
!Developed ia a way thet each player receives a persistent ID that remains consistent across the entire show.This ensures that a player is always “the same person” across all systems and game states.

2. Interaction Logic Framework
